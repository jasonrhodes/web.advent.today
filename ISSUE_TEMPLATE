Anything you are interested at the moment ! That being said, this is organized by a web developer and targeted to audience who also work in web industry. With that in mind, I welcome range of topics from productivity hacks to cool design you made. Just think of the kind of things you would show for lightning talk at meetups. 

It really don't need to be full-on tutorial or super cutting edge technology ðŸ™… (f'ck em). If you had some fun writing it & enjoyed sharing with others, that's the most important part âœ¨.
